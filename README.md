Introduction

The program prompts the user to enter an integer and determines whether the number is even or odd using a helper function.

 How It Works

1. The user inputs a number.
2. The program checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the `iseven` function.
3. It outputs whether the number is even or odd.

 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/even-odd-checker.git
   cd even-odd-checker

Compilation and Execution
Using g++ (Linux/MacOS/Windows with MinGW):

g++ even_odd.cpp -o even_odd
./even_odd

Example Output
Enter a number

The number is Even
Enter a number
